## Notes
This is my portfolio site, developed to show off my education, skills, certificates, projects, and other pieces of information not captured on my resume. 
Treat this as a way of getting to know me professionally.

This website's template came from ajlkn, who has licensed it for use by anyone on the internet. I took this template and expanded upon it, best fitting the design to my portfolio.
All credits are found here and in the license file.
